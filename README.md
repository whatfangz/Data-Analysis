# Portfolio

I am a soil scientist specializing in the role of the soil microbiome in soil health

I have experience in data analysis of genomic microbiome assessment, multivariate statistical analyses using R, Python, Jupyter Notebook, Colaboratory, JMP, Primer, SAS, CANOCO, etc.

I currently work on community-based soil testing, ecological design, and community education for community composting, urban farming, habitat restoration, and climate change mitigation. This Portfolio repository contains this work.

I am excited to unleash the potential of the soil microbiome!
